> engAGE seniors - enable older adults to live their lives to the fullest

engAGE seniors is a pioneer and leader in providing direct assistance to the elderly, their families, and professionals in the aging field. We assists older people and their caregivers to assess needs, identify service resources, and make the necessary connections to resolve elder care issues. engAGE seniors has pioneered the service mediation approach whereby our staff intervenes at points of crisis, bolster the family’s ability to cope, and help caregivers to understand and pursue the best available options for senior care.
See our interventions below.

### ADVOCACY: 

engAGE seniors model of advocacy is ‘Complete Circle’ of advocacy- WE MOVE FROM CASE TO CAUSE. engAGE seniors work with individuals and families through our various programmes makes us aware of the flaws in the present system and we suggest the changes needed with the long term care system. Systemic advocacy occurs at engAGE seniors in two ways, through educational efforts and influencing of public policy.


### COUNSELLING SERVICES FOR OLDER ADULTS: 

Our mission is to help older adults maintain their independence to the greatest extent possible and age in place by providing quality long term care services and emotional support. We endorse the fact that one of the greatest issues for older adults is loneliness. The issue of social isolation, coupled with depression, is an important factor that contributes to the high risk for ill health among this population.  Older adults often suffer losses that include friends, loved ones, health, income, and independence. 

The aim of our Older Adult Counselling Programs is to provide a safe and supportive environment where participants can address issues of concern and maintain their independence. Many older adults use their time with us to share thoughts about their day-to-day lives, to reminisce about the past, or to speculate about the future. All of these are good topics for discussion during counselling sessions.


### CRISIS INTERVENTION: 
 
Emergencies happen – we know that. If you’re faced with an elderly emergency in your family and need to speak with someone right away, call us today. Without an appointment, we are often able to provide same-day emergency consultations to identify options and help families decide their next steps. engAGE seniors is here to help when crises hit and your loved one needs help now. These problems may include depression, major life changes such as unemployment or loss of an important relationship, anxiety, feelings of hopelessness, thoughts of suicide, delusions, paranoia and substance abuse. Crisis often happen outside of normal business hours. With our 24 hour a day, 7-day a week availability, our clients and their families never need not feel alone when crises occur. 

### HOSPITAL ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE PLANNING:

Hospitalizations tend to be cumbersome especially with older adults. One has to plan well in advance, if not an emergency. Many older adults need physical assistance as well as emotional support during admissions. In our hospital set up, current scenario is nothing but a haphazard process with lot of running around between different stations. The complex and time consuming process of admission is definitely an unpleasant experience. Majority hospitals have no priority ‘check in’ for seniors. 

Many a time the primary care givers due to their hectic life schedules find it difficult to be present or facilitate admissions. Naturally the family members experience an extreme amount of distress when they learn about the disease and sometimes crestfallen and now making decisions for their family member is not an easy task. We can handhold you to facilitate admissions and thereby ease the painstaking process of admission.


Upon discharge from the hospital, decisions may need to be made regarding a senior’s return home or to a short-term stay at a rehabilitation centre. We are experts in transitional care and we can make the transit a pleasant experience. Our Care Managers can ease the stress of this process, by drawing a care plan according to the discharge summary by discussing the management and prognosis. In certain cases identifying a proper rehabilitation facility is not an easy task since all facilities are certainly not the same. From our experience in long term care, we can assist the family understand what questions to ask and what to look for to ensure the right fit and best services for our client.


If an older adult is able to return to their home, we ensure continuity of care by following the discharge note and arranging for necessary supportive services such as transportation, oxygen, a caregiver, periodic visits and any other assistance that is needed.


### COMPREHENSIVE GERIATRIC ASSESSMENT:

Many families tell us they are willing to do whatever is needed to help Mom and Dad live life to the fullest, but don’t know what steps to take. The best way to start is with a thorough geriatric assessment to review expectations and overall needs. Next step is goal setting. A thorough assessment includes reviewing the older adult's:

Physical Aspects, Clinical aspects,  Psychological wellness, 

Social wellness, Nutrition, Financial and legal aspects

Once this information is gathered, our Care Managers are able to address the client’s immediate needs. Through ongoing Care Management services, we offer assistance as those needs change over time. 
### SHARING A CARE PLAN AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION:

The care plan includes the results of the in-person assessment. We discuss options, provide recommendations and share ideas and referrals. We go into great depth explaining:

What led to the recommendations

What you can expect

A prioritized needs list

Costs of services

After the care plan has been shared and the Care Manager and family decide what steps to take, we have a discussion about what care the family feels they are able to do on their own and what they would like engAGE seniors to handle for them. Our service is customized to fit each client and family’s best interests. To provide peace of mind, we closely keep an eye on every detail to ensure that proper arrangements for service delivery are addressed.

### MEDICATION MANAGEMENT:

People age 65 and older consume more prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines than any other age group. Older people tend to have more long-term, chronic illnesses – such as arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease – than do younger people. Because they may have a number of diseases or disabilities at the same time, it is common for older people to take many different drugs. This may be riskier for older adults, especially when several medicines are used at one time. 

Taking different medicines is not always easy to do right. It may be hard to remember what each medicine is for, how you should take it and when you should take it. Utilizing our clinical Care Manager for Medication Management provides a safe and effective means to ensure compliance with medicine routine and avoid many of the complications from taking multiple medications.

### CARE HOME:

**Are you looking for a place to keep your loved one?**

Home is the first and the best option for the elders and we call it "Ageing in Place"! However, many a time, home fails to extend the support systems needed for adequate care giving during infirmity. As the age advances and when the health diminishes the care interventions get intensifies, and mostly many chronic health conditions may demand more professional care. This is when the institutionalized care comes as a probable option.

Our care home is for those who no longer fit to live in their own house due to ageing, illness or disability and needs more intense professional care. In our care facility we care for the bedridden elderly who needs long term care. Adequate health care, right nutrition and timely Nursing intervention are the central activity to achieve the goal to promote quality to the life of infirm elders.

At our care home, you or your loved ones can feel safe and well looked after with the highest standards of care that you'd expect from the leaders in long term care like engAGE seniors. Our staffs are experienced and adequately trained in long term care, helping with daily activities as well as specialist clinical care.

### COMA CARE:

Comas are always shocking. Although the best medical procedures attend to the immediate physical needs of the coma patients, family and friends are often at a loss in knowing how to support their loved ones further. Coma patients also deserve the same care and attention as any other human being. At engAGE seniors we believe that coma patients have the same human rights as everyone else in India. That is why we are concerned with coma care and the family members of those affected by comas.

engAGE seniors is concerned with the care of coma patients. engAGE seniors coma care is made up of motivated individuals; including health professionals, family members and care givers, who wish to improve and enhance the level of coma care in our society. engAGE seniors coma care strongly believes that those in comatose states are in meaningful life processes. We help coma patients, their family members and care givers understand the coma and get the help they need at this very difficult time. Our aim lies in building caring partnerships between medical and professional staff, care givers, family members and patients where everyone plays a role in the patient's recovery or dying process.

### HOME NURSING:

**Are you concerned about your aged parents?**

For most people, living as independently as you can in your home as you age is what you want. But sometimes you might need some help with daily tasks that you can no longer manage as well on your own. We value each person's uniqueness, life experience, abilities and aspirations and tailor our care to suit each person's need and choices.


At some point of time in your care giving journey, you may need a professional partner. Professional care givers are the backbone of the long term care industry. Though care giving is rewarding and gratifying, it is equally complex and tough. We understand the nuances and complexities of caregiving and train our caregivers to excel in their job. At engAGE seniors we identify the right individual, train, tune, sensitize, motivate and monitor to be successful caregiver.

Our care giver services are designed with the aim of meeting your changing needs as you get older. engAGE senior's home care package is a combination package of several services tailored to meet your care needs. An assessment by an Aged Care Assessment Team(ACAT) is required before you can receive a Home Care Package from engAGE seniors.

### RESPITE CARE:

**Are you worried about leaving your elderly loved one behind, while you are away?**
Caregiving is demanding and everyone needs a break. It is true and important that the primary care givers and families of the long term care patients needs a relief from caregiving responsibilities. Respite care provides caregivers a temporary test from caregiving, while the person with chronic illness continues to receive care in a safe environment.


If you are primary caregiver directly involved with the care of a long term care patient, then respite care can help you as a caregiver by providing a new environment or time to relax. Emergencies, unplanned situations, unexpected trips or even a planned vacation can create a need for immediate care by an alternate arrangement for care.


Do you worry about your loved one's safety and care while you travel for your official and personal commitments? If yes, here is an answer for that advantAGE Respite Care. Whether it be institutionalized care or domiciliary care we extend respite care so that you can be at ease while you travel.

### FOSTER CARE:

Foster care is signed when the children or the immediate relative is staying miles away and there are no adequate support systems in place for the elders. This will supplement long distance caregiving. In simple terms, we assume the role of the family. Foster care is needed when the family is not in station and the patient needs care and monitoring. 

We assist with physician office visit, hospitalizations and monitoring at regular intervals especially when the patient is left alone. Once we are assigned the care as per the foster care agreement, we will also attend the crisis situations. We update the immediate family as and when needed and get the orders from them and act accordingly. The benefit of the foster care system is that the family who is away and worried about the care of the family member can be at ease when we supplement their role. We act as proxy.
