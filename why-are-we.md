engAGE seniors is not another average care provider! With experience spanning 17 years in social gerontology, we are passionate about changing the face of the care industry. We are a specialty care provider offering institutionalized care as well as home care supporting to a wide range of ages and needs, enabling people to live healthier and happy life. 


Past experience tells us that health education with an emphasis on social gerontology aspects is vital in maintaining good health in later years. Independency is a fiercely guarded purpose for most elderly people regardless of their health conditions. This is an expression of self-respect and pride. Elderly people seek help in gaining independency. The health education offered should contribute to their self-management skills. We strongly believe in creating awareness among the old people and their immediate family about healthy ageing and the safeguards.


Years into social gerontology practice by us suggests that seniors who are socially engaged also are healthier, mentally and physically. That’s why engAGE seniors is committed to supporting older adults with the unique programmes and services they need to continue to engage in their communities throughout their lives.  With the help of like minded people and partners from both the public and private sectors, engAGE seniors is working to connect older Indians and their families to the systems of services and supports available to help them remain healthy, live independently, prevent abuse and neglect, and support caregivers.


Indeed, the experience of ageing—whether you’re doing it alone or assisting a loved one or neighbour on that journey—is very personal. Everyone goes through the process a little differently, with different joys, reflections, challenges, and accomplishments.  


And the ways we choose to engage are very personal, too. People engage to help others, by volunteering at their church, mentoring younger people, or helping to raise grandchildren, for example. They engage to stay healthy – maybe they learn to dance or to better manage chronic diseases. They are encouraged to age in place – by putting sufficient support systems in place. Everyone has their own story and since we worked with these older adults from close quarters we are better positioned to understand the challenges and ultimately problem solving. It’s how we pass wisdom to others, by sharing the individual stories, thus learn about the past and advocate for a brighter future. By sharing the stories of aging and older Indians, we celebrate our triumphs, share our wisdom, advocate for each other, and build stronger communities for all of us.


Why are we here? The answer is, to empower elders and their families with the right kind of education and support enabling the older adults to enjoy life, stay well,
