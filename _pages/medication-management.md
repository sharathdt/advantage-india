### MEDICATION MANAGEMENT:

People age 65 and older consume more prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines than any other age group. Older people tend to have more long-term, chronic illnesses – such as arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease – than do younger people. Because they may have a number of diseases or disabilities at the same time, it is common for older people to take many different drugs. This may be riskier for older adults, especially when several medicines are used at one time. 

Taking different medicines is not always easy to do right. It may be hard to remember what each medicine is for, how you should take it and when you should take it. Utilizing our clinical Care Manager for Medication Management provides a safe and effective means to ensure compliance with medicine routine and avoid many of the complications from taking multiple medications.
