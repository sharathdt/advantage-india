We assists older people and their caregivers to assess needs, identify service resources, and make the necessary connections to resolve elder care issues. engAGE seniors has pioneered the service mediation approach whereby our staff intervenes at points of crisis, bolster the familyâ€™s ability to cope, and help caregivers to understand and pursue the best available options for senior care.



### CARE HOME:

**Are you looking for a place to keep your loved one?**

Home is the first and the best option for the elders and we call it "Ageing in Place"! However, many a time, home fails to extend the support systems needed for adequate care giving during infirmity. As the age advances and when the health diminishes the care interventions get intensifies, and mostly many chronic health conditions may demand more professional care. This is when the institutionalized care comes as a probable option.

Our care home is for those who no longer fit to live in their own house due to ageing, illness or disability and needs more intense professional care. In our care facility we care for the bedridden elderly who needs long term care. Adequate health care, right nutrition and timely Nursing intervention are the central activity to achieve the goal to promote quality to the life of infirm elders.

At our care home, you or your loved ones can feel safe and well looked after with the highest standards of care that you'd expect from the leaders in long term care like engAGE seniors. Our staffs are experienced and adequately trained in long term care, helping with daily activities as well as specialist clinical care.
