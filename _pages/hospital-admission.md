### HOSPITAL ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE PLANNING:

Hospitalizations tend to be cumbersome especially with older adults. One has to plan well in advance, if not an emergency. Many older adults need physical assistance as well as emotional support during admissions. In our hospital set up, current scenario is nothing but a haphazard process with lot of running around between different stations. The complex and time consuming process of admission is definitely an unpleasant experience. Majority hospitals have no priority ‘check in’ for seniors. 

Many a time the primary care givers due to their hectic life schedules find it difficult to be present or facilitate admissions. Naturally the family members experience an extreme amount of distress when they learn about the disease and sometimes crestfallen and now making decisions for their family member is not an easy task. We can handhold you to facilitate admissions and thereby ease the painstaking process of admission.


Upon discharge from the hospital, decisions may need to be made regarding a senior’s return home or to a short-term stay at a rehabilitation centre. We are experts in transitional care and we can make the transit a pleasant experience. Our Care Managers can ease the stress of this process, by drawing a care plan according to the discharge summary by discussing the management and prognosis. In certain cases identifying a proper rehabilitation facility is not an easy task since all facilities are certainly not the same. From our experience in long term care, we can assist the family understand what questions to ask and what to look for to ensure the right fit and best services for our client.


If an older adult is able to return to their home, we ensure continuity of care by following the discharge note and arranging for necessary supportive services such as transportation, oxygen, a caregiver, periodic visits and any other assistance that is needed.
