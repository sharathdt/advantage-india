> engAGE seniors - enable older adults to live their lives to the fullest

engAGE seniors is a pioneer and leader in providing direct assistance to the elderly, their families, and professionals in the aging field. We assists older people and their caregivers to assess needs, identify service resources, and make the necessary connections to resolve elder care issues. engAGE seniors has pioneered the service mediation approach whereby our staff intervenes at points of crisis, bolster the family’s ability to cope, and help caregivers to understand and pursue the best available options for senior care.


### SHARING A CARE PLAN AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION:

The care plan includes the results of the in-person assessment. We discuss options, provide recommendations and share ideas and referrals. We go into great depth explaining:

What led to the recommendations

What you can expect

A prioritized needs list

Costs of services

After the care plan has been shared and the Care Manager and family decide what steps to take, we have a discussion about what care the family feels they are able to do on their own and what they would like engAGE seniors to handle for them. Our service is customized to fit each client and family’s best interests. To provide peace of mind, we closely keep an eye on every detail to ensure that proper arrangements for service delivery are addressed.
