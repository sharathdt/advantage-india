engAGE seniors is a pioneer and leader in providing direct assistance to the elderly, their families, and professionals in the aging field. We assists older people and their caregivers to assess needs, identify service resources, and make the necessary connections to resolve elder care issues. engAGE seniors has pioneered the service mediation approach whereby our staff intervenes at points of crisis, bolster the family’s ability to cope, and help caregivers to understand and pursue the best available options for senior care.



### FOSTER CARE:

Foster care is signed when the children or the immediate relative is staying miles away and there are no adequate support systems in place for the elders. This will supplement long distance caregiving. In simple terms, we assume the role of the family. Foster care is needed when the family is not in station and the patient needs care and monitoring. 

We assist with physician office visit, hospitalizations and monitoring at regular intervals especially when the patient is left alone. Once we are assigned the care as per the foster care agreement, we will also attend the crisis situations. We update the immediate family as and when needed and get the orders from them and act accordingly. The benefit of the foster care system is that the family who is away and worried about the care of the family member can be at ease when we supplement their role. We act as proxy.
