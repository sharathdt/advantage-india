### RESPITE CARE:

**Are you worried about leaving your elderly loved one behind, while you are away?**

Caregiving is demanding and everyone needs a break. It is true and important that the primary care givers and families of the long term care patients needs a relief from caregiving responsibilities. Respite care provides caregivers a temporary test from caregiving, while the person with chronic illness continues to receive care in a safe environment.


If you are primary caregiver directly involved with the care of a long term care patient, then respite care can help you as a caregiver by providing a new environment or time to relax. Emergencies, unplanned situations, unexpected trips or even a planned vacation can create a need for immediate care by an alternate arrangement for care.
