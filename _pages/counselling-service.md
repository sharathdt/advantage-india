Our mission is to help older adults maintain their independence to the greatest extent possible and age in place by providing quality long term care services and emotional support. We endorse the fact that one of the greatest issues for older adults is loneliness. The issue of social isolation, coupled with depression, is an important factor that contributes to the high risk for ill health among this population.  Older adults often suffer losses that include friends, loved ones, health, income, and independence.

The aim of our Older Adult Counselling Programs is to provide a safe and supportive environment where participants can address issues of concern and maintain their independence. Many older adults use their time with us to share thoughts about their day-to-day lives, to reminisce about the past, or to speculate about the future. All of these are good topics for discussion during counselling sessions.
