### HOME NURSING:

**Are you concerned about your aged parents?**

For most people, living as independently as you can in your home as you age is what you want. But sometimes you might need some help with daily tasks that you can no longer manage as well on your own. We value each person's uniqueness, life experience, abilities and aspirations and tailor our care to suit each person's need and choices.


At some point of time in your care giving journey, you may need a professional partner. Professional care givers are the backbone of the long term care industry. Though care giving is rewarding and gratifying, it is equally complex and tough. We understand the nuances and complexities of caregiving and train our caregivers to excel in their job. At engAGE seniors we identify the right individual, train, tune, sensitize, motivate and monitor to be successful caregiver.

Our care giver services are designed with the aim of meeting your changing needs as you get older. engAGE senior's home care package is a combination package of several services tailored to meet your care needs. An assessment by an Aged Care Assessment Team(ACAT) is required before you can receive a Home Care Package from engAGE seniors.
