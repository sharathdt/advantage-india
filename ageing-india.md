Discussing and projecting statistics of the aging population in India is not to alarm, it is something to pay attention to and to celebrate. India is different from many developing nations and that is why we need to understand its Population aging is gradually becoming a concern for both developed and developing nations. In India, the elderly depend upon the joint family system for care-giving support. However, factors such as industrialization, migration, and urbanization have disrupted the joint family system and resulted in the growth of nuclear families. In the process, the elderly are encountering both economic and emotional problems.


According to the 2011 census data, India is home to 104 million elderly people (aged 60 years and above), 53 million women and 51 million men. Most (71 percent) of the elderly reside in rural areas; 29 percent reside in urban areas. The 2011 census also revealed that 15 million elderly people live alone and three-fourths of them are women. India is facing an elderly population 'time bomb' according to a United Nations report which revealed its number of old people will triple by 2050. The report, by the United Nations Population Fund, found the number of over-60s will increase from around 100 million today to more than 300 million by 2050 and warned the government to prepare for the additional strain this will put on families and health and welfare services. It also predicted the number of over-80s will increase sevenfold.


These statistics are indicative of the fact that the concerns of the elderly need to be addressed with priority. These statistics are indicative of the fact that the concerns of the elderly need to be addressed with priority. 


In the context of criminal activities it is important to note that the elderly are often victims of physical abuse by both family members and outsiders. A recent study conducted by the Agewell Foundation revealed that two-thirds of the elderly are neglected by their family members and one-third have suffered physical and verbal abuse. Around 65 percent of the elderly indicated that they faced neglect in their old age and over half (54.1 percent) mentioned that they suffered abuse within their families. Every fourth senior citizen admitted that they are being exploited by their family members.


Additionally, the study also highlighted that 89.7 percent and 96.4 percent of the elderly faced abuse for financial and emotional reasons respectively. Lack of respect and property-related matters are considered to be the major reasons for elderly abuse by family members in India. 


The Indian State has considerable provisions for the elderly; however, the incidences of physical abuse and the growing crime rate highlight the fact that there is a clear lack of implementation. In fact it could be suggested that there is a lack of awareness among older adults regarding the existence of these policies. As per Indian tradition, older adults usually depend on their sons to fulfill their economic and emotional needs. Hence older adults in India are ill-prepared to live alone or make financial arrangements for themselves.


In contrast, other countries with aging populations have implemented policies to make older adults self-sufficient and independent. Similarly China, which long relied on the tradition of filial piety (adult children providing care to older parents), is shifting to long-term care goals by establishing alternative care giving arrangements. Drawing from the examples of these countries, the main aim is to make older adults self-sufficient and aid them in the aging process. In India, on the other hand, it seems that older adults do not avail themselves of the benefits of existing policies and are increasingly victims of abuse and crime.


India's soaring population is expected to increase from 1.2 billion today to above 1.6 billion by 2050 – by when it is expected to have overtaken China's ageing population to become the world's largest nation. The report warned that India's current hospital and welfare services are  insufficient for the strain they will face as the pace of population ageing increases. "These findings underline that with a growing elderly population in the country there is a need to strengthen geriatric care services in the existing public health system so that the increasing care demands of the elderly can be met," the report warned. It also said the government must increase the availability and take-up of welfare benefits by the elderly poor.
