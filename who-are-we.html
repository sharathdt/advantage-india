<h3>ROSHAN JACOB</h3>
<p>
Our Chairman, Roshan Jacob got inspired to start a home based care for the elderly after working many years in many corporate hospitals. For many years, Jacob worked in healthcare as a hospital administrator. While in the hospital environment, he watched many of his patients – especially seniors – leave the facility and return home, but not necessarily return to health. Once home, a lot of his former patients were unable to care for themselves. During when he worked at the hospitals he felt that there is a massive dearth of quality services to the elderly and Mr. Jacob realized that he could make a difference, not just in the senior care industry but by providing reliable and compassionate long term care for people of all ages.

<p>
Jacob knew that with a little help, most of these people could lead healthy, happy lives in their own homes. But he also knew that there were very few professional companies that offered this kind of help. First, he observed and studied dozens of families to understand the different kinds of challenges they faced and what kind of care would help. This is when he realized that more and more people are striving to “age in place” which refers to the ability of any person to grow old in their own home or that of their family.

As Social Gerontology Consultant and the Chairman of engAGE Seniors, Roshan Jacob, has spent the past 12 years helping families with a rare combination of Law and public health background. Education spanning from St. Berchman's Kerala, Law College Trivandrum, BITS Pilani, CMC Vellore, and National Law school is what makes him stand out. Being a honorary member of the American Geriatrics Society and Gerontological Society of Australia, he has extensive knowledge in the realm of social gerontology. Jacob and his team of Masters-level social workers will guide you seamlessly through the available options, focusing on patient needs and the family’s needs.
</p>
<p>
His educational background and several years in the hospital industry, helped him to initiate his vision. While researching the availability of the health care support systems for the elderly he realized that there is a huge gap between “what is there and what should be there” in the realm of Geriatric Care. 12 years back, the concept of Gerontology and Geriatrics are not developed or even heard off in the country. So we are proud to say that, we pioneered Social Gerontology in India.

<h3>SOUMYA NAIR</h3>
<p>
Truly, Soumya Nair is compassion unlimited and from a very young age she discovered social work as her calling. She had her schooling and college in Mysore and even before she completed her studies she has been keenly associated with the orphaned children's education. In her college days she used to find time for teaching and helping these underprivileged children while her friends while away the time.
</p>
<p>
Soumya Nair joined engAGE seniors in the year 2002, and soon she took over the mantle as the executive director. Soumya has successfully steered the organization as a thriving business model which is more of a social enterprise. Following the footsteps of Mr. Roshan Jacob, the founder of engAGE seniors, Soumya at the helm as CEO and ED has transformed the organization as a household name in long term care in Bangalore. Today known all over Bangalore as pioneer in social gerontology, cares more than 500 patients of different ages and in different settings. Soumya is without question the most sought after geriatric care professional in the realm of social gerontology in Bangalore.
</p>
<p>
She advocates for more senior friendly approaches and civic responsibility through her Nurse Competency Lectures, and regular columns in dailies. She reaches out to the infirm elderly and long term care patients through her two NGOs, engAGE and Swavalambhini, which provide elder care, long term care, education, training, counselling and health care to the urban and rural poor. Her latest initiative, “Continuing Competency for Nurses”, aims to equip the nurse fraternity with the skills in guided care nursing.

"What makes Soumya ... one of the most admired senor service provider is the way she reaches out to people as a social gerontolist and person behind two organizations founded for causes close to her heart -- senior's welfare and distressed women's development through skill development." wrote India Today. Profiled by India Today as a low profile and dedicated women entrepreneur, Soumya considers her work among the infirm elderly and the rehabilitated distressed women should inspire the younger generation because she thinks more and more women should be sensitive to elder care issues.
</p>
<p>
Organising seminars on pre-retirement, Conducting workshops in Continuing Competency for Nurses, counselling senior citizens and their family members and training young people for caregiving, takes up the bulk of Nair's day. Today, Soumya is a beacon of hope for the hundreds of senior citizens and their families who are in the twilight of their life, filled with pent-up frustrations due ill health and the issues of caregiving. She considers the smile in the face of an elderly patient as a bonus.
